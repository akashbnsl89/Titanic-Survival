# Titanic-Survival
Hello! This is my first Machine Learning project which I have been able to carry out end to end. I took help from the notebook of @Nadin Tamer (https://www.kaggle.com/nadintamer/titanic-survival-predictions-beginner/notebook). The notebook and the analysis is very well explained and makes the learning easy and interesting.
Thanks!!
